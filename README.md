## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sarah Dankwa and I am a junior data engineer with a passion for Python and SQL!

I am currently working on a comprehensive data pipeline solution leveraging tools such as PostgreSQL, Amazon S3 and Lambda and creating visualisations using Power BI.

I am also working towards the DEA-C01 - AWS Certified Data Engineer - Associate exam.

I am looking to do a few projects using Databricks to enhance my toolkit.
